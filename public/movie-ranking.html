<p>Definitely should watch! You guys, this is one of the og k-drama that really suites all of people, all ages, and a good one foo the k-drama-beginner. The point of view, the story, the messages, all hit. The background story is about a simple life of families that live together and make the most of it.</p>


<h3>Prison Playbook</h3>
<p>The series is about life of prisoner, their different personalities and different background stories really got my heart. Should watch! Thank Me later :) Oh prepare your tissues.</p>

<h3>Hospital Playlist</h3>
<p>This!! The story is about life as hospital/health worker, 5 bestfriends work together. The most fun to watch. Light but no boring! A dream friend group for sure.</p>
